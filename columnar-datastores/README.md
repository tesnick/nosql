# Columnar data stores

The columnar data stores are designed for storing, querying and managing structured data. Much like relational database management systems, they use tables, rows, and columns however the names and format of the columns may vary from row to row within the same table. Many columnar data stores are built on a principles described by Google in the paper Bigtable: [A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data](http://research.google.com/archive/bigtable.html).

The columnar data stores do have a very wide range of applicability so it is very hard to come up with the precise list of recommendations.
